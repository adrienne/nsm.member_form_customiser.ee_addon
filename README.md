h2. NSM Member Form Customiser

Show and hide CP member fields in "My Account".

h2. Settings

I've put the settings inside the actual accessory, bad I know but it was a quick solution to get something working.

Comment out $this->hide array elements to remove fields from member profile.

@todo: Add a better settings form.
